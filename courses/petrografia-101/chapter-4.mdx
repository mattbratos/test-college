# Chapter 4 - Rock Classification

## Introduction
Welcome to Chapter 4 of Petrografia 101! This is where the magic happens as we dive into the world of rock classification. Understanding how to classify rocks based on their characteristics is essential for deciphering the geological history written in the layers of the Earth. You’ll learn to master key classification schemes—particularly the QAPF diagram for igneous rocks, and explore the criteria of texture and mineralogy that define rock types. Grab your rock hammer, and let’s get started!

## Overview of the Classification Schemes

### QAPF Diagram for Igneous Rocks
The QAPF diagram is a powerful tool for classifying igneous rocks based on their mineral composition and relative proportions. Here’s the breakdown:

- **Quartz (Q)**: A common mineral found in many rock types.
- **Alkali Feldspar (A)**: Includes orthoclase and sanidine.
- **Plagioclase (P)**: A solid solution between albite and anorthite.
- **Ferromagnesian minerals (F)**: This group includes olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite.

The diagram organizes rock types into different zones based on the percentages of Q, A, P, and F present. Here's a simplified representation:

```
         Q
     ----|----
    |     |    |
    |  A  |  P |
    |     |    |
    |-----F-----|
         F
```

### Other Classification Schemes
- **Sedimentary rocks**: Classified based on the origin (clastic, chemical, biological), grain size, and composition.
- **Metamorphic rocks**: Classified based on the parent rock, texture (foliated vs. non-foliated), and mineral content.

Understanding these schemes lays the groundwork for identifying and classifying various rocks you'll encounter in the field.

## Criteria for Classification: Texture and Mineralogy

### Texture
The texture of a rock is determined by the size, shape, and arrangement of its mineral grains. Here are some key terms to help you identify texture:

- **Fine-grained**: Minerals are too small to see with the naked eye (e.g., basalt).
- **Coarse-grained**: Individual minerals are noticeable and can be easily seen (e.g., granite).
- **Glassy**: Rocks that have cooled extremely quickly and lack a crystalline structure (e.g., obsidian).

### Mineralogy
The mineral composition of a rock is essential for classification. The presence of specific minerals can indicate the rock's origin and conditions of formation. 

Common minerals include:

- **Quartz**
- **Feldspars**
- **Micas**
- **Amphiboles**
- **Pyroxenes**
- **Olivine**

To classify rocks, you observe both their texture and mineral content in tandem.

## Practical Exercises on Identifying Rock Samples

### Exercise 1: Rock Sample Identification
- Gather a selection of rock samples (you can either collect them from your backyard or use images).
- Examine each sample and note the following:
  - **Texture**: Is it fine-grained, coarse-grained, or glassy?
  - **Minerals present**: Identify minerals using a hand lens or mineral identification kits.

### Exercise 2: Use the QAPF Diagram
- Using your identified samples, plot them on the QAPF diagram based on the mineral composition.
- Classify each rock into its corresponding type (e.g., granite, diorite, basalt, etc.).

### Exercise 3: Group Classification Challenge
- Work in small groups to investigate a set of unknown rock samples.
- Use the classification schemes discussed to present your identification and classification findings to the class.

## Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we learned about rock classification and the essential tools, such as the QAPF diagram, to decode rocks based on their mineral content and texture. The criteria of texture and mineralogy are pivotal in determining the characteristics of rocks. By engaging in practical exercises, you applied these concepts to real-world rock samples, setting the stage for more in-depth study in the following chapters.

Now that you're armed with this foundational knowledge, you’re ready to dive into the intricate techniques of petrographic analysis in the next chapter!
